AgriConnect

AgriConnect is a single smart app that serves as a complete ecosystem for Indian farmers. It combines multiple essential services into one platform to solve daily farming problems and reduce financial and logistical stress.


The Problem
Farmers in India face significant daily struggles. The project aims to solve several key issues:


Market & Price Issues: Farmers often don't get fair prices for their crops due to middlemen and lack of access to real-time market data.



Crop & Yield Problems: Early detection of crop diseases is difficult, leading to large yield losses and financial stress.


Labour & Resource Gaps: Finding labor on time for crucial activities like sowing and harvesting is a challenge. Farmers also waste time searching for farming supplies across different shops.



Financial & Social Stress: Farmers face immense pressure from loan repayments, which can lead to high stress and, tragically, a rise in farmer suicides in some regions.


The Solution: Key Features
AgriConnect addresses these problems with an integrated, AI-powered platform.


AI Disease Detection: The app identifies crop diseases and suggests immediate cures and fertilizers from a photo.



Direct Market Access: It provides live mandi prices and enables direct connection with buyers, helping farmers get better profit margins by eliminating middlemen.



AI Crop Guidance & Planning: The platform gives smart, AI-based recommendations on what to grow based on the season, soil type, and profit predictions.



On-Demand Labor Booking: Farmers can instantly hire nearby laborers, similar to a ride-sharing service.



Agri-Shop: A digital e-commerce shop where farmers can order seeds, fertilizers, and tools online for home delivery, saving them time and money.




Smart Financial & Stress Relief: The app helps manage loan repayments with timely reminders and provides cash-flow forecasts to warn of potential stress. It also offers support for suicide prevention by providing early alerts and helpline links.






Multilingual & Voice Support: The app supports regional languages and includes voice-to-text and text-to-speech features for accessibility and ease of use.


How It Works: User Flow
The AgriConnect user flow is designed to be intuitive and comprehensive.
